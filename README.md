# Capstone project description:

This App should help friends to coordinate and organize a group trip.

## Documentation:

- deleted SimpleFrames from global.css
- created Container Component for styled container frames
  - just to make sure, that it can be reused and the code doesnt get so crowdy
- next step was to arrange all elements properly in a column

## User Story 2:

- In this user story i will create a list-component because this the list-item should be reusable later on in this project.
- Therefore i am creating a new folder called "TripDetails" to store the index.js of the first user story in it.
  - This is also to prepare dynamic routing and a slug.js-file for later usage
- After this, i created a new index.js and left in the pages-folder
  - This new index.js represents the new start page
- By now i use hardcoded data but in future the data will be fetched by a form

### Challenges:

- An challenge was to pass to props correctly into the list-item in the index.js file
- Resizing the Image-Component within the li-component
  - At the end i just created a new Image-Component and styled this until it fits properly. But to be honest, i am not very satisfied with this solution.

## User Story 3:

- Fixed the li element and put a Link component into it.
